// Possible strategies:
//	1. Character bounding box enters obstacle bounding box.
//		This would have 4-way directionality (North, East, South, West)
//	2. Character circular zone enters circular zone of the obstacle.
//		This would have 360-degrees of directionality (More than is needed for this game)
//	3. Character sprite overlaps with obstacle sprite.
//		More difficult to come up with directionality.
//
//	Directionality is needed to stop character from moving forward 
//	in the direction of the collision.
//
//	Not all sprites will block the character.
