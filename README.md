# The Game Project, Stage 2
At release, this will be an fun and whimsical 2D/3D adventure game of the same genre as the original "Legend of Zelda."  Written in DirectX 11, C++, and XAML this continues the work of Stage 1 of this project.
Whereas the focus of Stage 1 was to develop core DirectX rendering functionality, Stage 2 develops a data model which is used to represent entities in the game world.  A world world map has been developed for the "outer world."  The player can now traverse through the multi-screen world.  A ServiceProxy project has been added which will connect to Web Services.
In Stage 3, the underworld will be developed which will include caves and dungeons.  Multi-screen functionality will be refined.  The ServiceProxy will connect to remote web services.  Gameplay and storyline will be further developed.



To compile and run, you will need Visual Studio 2015 and Windows 10 installed on your system.  The use of an XBox One controller is recommended.
